Video: How to Think about Networking

Humans are two different things that need to be connected by a path through which we can send communications

Networking: how to create a path between us and another person for communication

Networks are as fragile as the amount of time and effort put into the care and maintenance of the connections

Ask what you can do for your network

Find one point where common stories converge

Professional network:

Not necessary to know people on the personal level

If it does not work, just move on

Personal network:

Wanting to know more about them

Wanting to learn something from them

Steps to start networking:

Do your research to identify who to connect with

Look for smaller opportunities around the larger events

Engage with the conference speakers

Focus on what you can learn at networking events

Networking as a map model: various ways to connect to a person 

Downside of networking within your industry: not expanding the amount of information or connections you have through them

Within your industry, network with people at higher levels than your role

Outside of your industry, network with people with diverse skill sets

Networking questions to ask yourself:

What am I learning through this connection?

Would I want to work with this person?

Networks and communities require constantly tending and cultivating for them to be healthy

Group your network connections

Core network:

About your support system

Not about careers or jobs

Intentional about sustaining the relationships

Current network:

People important to you for the time you are in

Connect with them on social media

Find something to do together to sustain the relationships

Broader community:

Weaker ties

Keep them healthy by connecting them to other people, who can care for them

Networking is about building trusted relationships

Video: Connecting Others

Be authentic

Help people

When connecting someone, ask yourself these questions:

Can my identity help to connect others?

Can my experience help build connections?

How can my location build connections?
