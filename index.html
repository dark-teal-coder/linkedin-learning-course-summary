Video: Structuring Your Pitch
<ul>
    <li>Example: “That’s right. {[summary label] I’m a developer.} I write a lot of code. {[past industry] I started with Ernst & Young for a few years} {[current industry] but then jumped to one of my clients: Proctor & Gamble. I’ve been working with them mostly in support of the brand development team for one of their package-goods divisions.} {[future aspirations] I love the work, but I’ve begun to think more about the big picture, so I’m looking for opportunities to move into management roles.}”</li>
    <li>Example: “My background is manufacturing, mostly high tech. Right now, I’m the general manager of a large facility for GenTech. We’re an electronic components company headquartered in Hong Kong. I love being the shop environment, seeing things being created, but eventually hope to move into executive roles.”</li>
    <li>Exclude education to avoid sounding inexperienced unless you are currently in graduate school or in your first year of professional work after undergraduate</li>
    <li>Pitch qualities:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Confident but not arrogant</li>
            <li>Short</li>
            <li>More generic than specific</li>
