<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/developing-a-youtube-strategy">Course URL</a>
<br>
Video: Get Your YouTube Channel Started Right

Type of videos to make
When to release them
Effectively formatting your videos
Researching your competitions
Optimizing your videos for search

Video: Consistency in Content

Focus on and measure your channel’s goal:
To generate revenue
Make sure that every video has a call to action that drives the viewer towards making a purchase
E.g., doing a product review with affiliate links to purchase it
To build a community
To advertise a product
To support your passion
Whatever the channel’s goal is, make sure it drives the purpose behind all of your content
Content consistency: consistency pertains not only to when you release a video but also to the content in your video
Make sure your content on your channel stays focused
The most successful channels:
Clear
Concise
Focused on a specific theme or topic

Video: Viral VS. Audience-building Content

Channel’s goal: 1) a viral video 2) an audience building video
Viral videos
Characteristics:
Shocking
Surprising
Impressive
Weird
Funny
Combo of the above factors
Short in length
Extremely sharable
No knowledge or viewership of other videos on the channel required
Pros:
View count
Cons:
Not build a strong audience
Not a huge conversion rate from viewers to subscribers
Audience building videos
Characteristics:
Connecting and communicating with viewers
Encouraging participation as part of the community
Ask them to suggest topics
Encourage them to ask a question that you can answer in your future video
No specific set length
Pros:
Higher subscriber conversion rate
Build a fan base that sometimes will support you through merchandise purchasing and crowdfunding
Cons:
No massive boom in views

Video: Trending VS. Evergreen Content

Treading videos
Related to a specific trending topic
Revolving around events, fads, holidays and the latest internet challenge
Limited shelf life
Gaining a lot of views quickly
Once the topic is no longer hot, views tend to drastically taper off
Evergreen videos
Not built around current trends
Continuing to bring in views as they remain topical
How-tos
Educational
Lists
Q & A
Long-lasting product reviews

Video: Quality VS. Quantity

Quality and quantity tend to be negatively correlated since it takes a lot of time to produce high-quality content
Balance between quality and quantity
At what level of quality, you should make your videos, first figure out the quantity of videos to make in a month
Built-in weekly video release expectation for YouTube
YouTube subscribers want your content to be there on the same day every week
One video a week is the minimum the YouTube algorithm likes best
Key: consistency & clear communication
Make sure you consistently release videos on the same day and communicate that to your fans

Video: Research Your Competition

Researching your competition before launching your channel is key to setting yourself up for success
Know what is already out there so you can stand out
Tips
Know your biggest competition
Familiarize yourself with their audience to see what they like and dislike
By looking at their videos, you can spot trends, get ideas for video topics and thumbnails, general video formatting and shooting methods
What content has the most and the least views?
How to engage the audience
Asking a question at the end of each video to respond to in the comments
Reading audience comments in Q&A video
Find ways to make your content similar to successful videos but with your own unique spin
Find a fresh perspective on the topic that stands out
Film differently
Cultural point of view
Catering to a niche not currently represented

Video: Optimize for Search

Build your video around frequently search keywords is key
Tagging your videos with keywords not enough
Good keywords
Heavily searched
Low competition
Use TubeBuddy YouTube plugin to see keyword analytics
Research the keywords before shooting your videos so you can incorporate them into the videos
Saying the keywords in your videos multiple times to signal to the algorithm that the video is really about that keyword
Put target keywords at the beginning of the video title
Put target keywords at top of the video description section (which is visible in search)

Video: Planning Out Your Content and Release Schedule

Consistent release schedule can greatly build your channel and maintain a fan base
Setting a specific time and day for release schedule
When is best to post a YouTube video?
Best days: Thursdays and Fridays
Best times: between 12:00 and 15:00
4 tips for a successful release schedule
Be consistent
Post to social media a day or two before the release
Share your video everywhere
The first 24 hours are the most critical times to get views
Batch recording videos
A stockpile of videos ready to go

Video: Social Media Promotion

1hr to 24hr after video release is critical for the algorithm
Promoting your videos on social media to drive traffic to your videos and reach potential new subscribers
Create social media accounts specifically for your channel
Focus on one first
Choose a platform that enables you to post links to YouTube
Post about your video right away once it releases

Video: Having A Website

Having your own website outside of YouTube can:
Help you rank in Google search
Bring in viewers and reach broader audience
Legitimize you as an expert in your niche
Land more brand deals
Drive more traffic to your channel
